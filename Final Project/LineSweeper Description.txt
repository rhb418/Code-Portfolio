This Java project represents the implementation of a custom game called linesweeper. This implementation
uses a variety of JavaFX objects to create an interactive two player game with a start page describing the 
rules and allowing the players to select one of three difficulties. The players can then launch the game and play 
until completion. Following the end of the game the players can then load a final page to calculate the score and
determine the winner.
