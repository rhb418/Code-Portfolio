# Code-Portfolio
Programming Portfolio for Robert Barnette

## Breakout
This Java/JavaFX project is an implementation of the popular game breakout which consists of four distinct levels, multiple powerups, and cheat codes. I fully developed all aspects of this project and specific features and controls can be viewed in the project README.md. 

## Cell Society
This project is written in Java and visualizes cellular automata simulations with starting configurations that can be specified using XML files. I developed this project with two other Duke University students and I worked primarily on the backend by designing an inheritance hierarhy to execute the simulation logic for different simulations. I also designed a class to represent the current state of the simulation as well as functionailty allowing for different neighborhood calculation algorithms. The features are described more extensively in the project README.md. 

## Object Oriented Game Architecture (ooga)
This project represents a simple game engine for 2D games implemented in Java. This engine allows 2D games such as Geometry Dash, Mario, and Galaga to be implemented using JSON configuration files that define game object positions and behaviors. I developed this project remotely along with two other Duke students as well as two Duke Kunshan University students in China. For this project, I worked primarily on designing an efficient directional collision detection and rectification algorithm to help detect and mediate interactions between game objects. I also created a system allowing the user to specify win and loss conditions and created configuration files for our implementation of Geometry Dash. 

## SLogo  
This project also was created using Java/JavaFX and implements a simplified version of the Logo programming language, providing a GUI for users to enter and see the results of executed commands. I created this project with three other Duke students where I worked primarily on the backend to execute the user's inputs and return results to the frontend. I designed an inhertiance hiearchy with each possible user command represented as a class extending an abstract command super class. I also designed an algorithm to correctly execute commands in the proper order when the user types multiple commands at once. The features of this project are also more extensively discussed in the project README.md. 

## HackDuke 2020 Project
This project was designed to be a web-based carpool clustering tool that would match school children into carpool groups helping parents to more efficiently transport children to and from school. I created this project along with four other Duke students as a part of the HackDuke 2020 programming competition. I worked primarily on the backend, using Python's Requests library and Google's Geocoding API to convert addresses into longitude latitude coordinates. 

## Processor 
This project is a complete five-stage pipelined processor written in Verilog that implements an assembly language similar to MIPS32. This processor also contains a random number generation module that can be used to generate random 32 bit values.
