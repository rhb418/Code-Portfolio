# Code-Portfolio
Programming Portfolio for Robert Barnette

## Breakout
This Java/JavaFX project is an implementation of the popular game breakout which consists of four distinct levels, multiple powerups, and cheat codes. I fully developed all aspects of this project and specific features and controls can be viewed in the project README.md. 

## Cell Society
This project is written in Java and visualizes cellular automata simulations with starting configurations that can be specified using XML configuration files. I developed this project with two other Duke University students and I worked primarily on the backend by designing an inheritance hierarhy to execute the simulation logic for different simulations. I also designed a class to represent the current state of the simulation as well as functionailty allowing for different neighborhood calculation algorithms. The features are described more extensively in the project README.md. 

## Object Oriented Game Architecture (ooga)
This project represents a simple game engine for 2D games implemented in Java. This engine allows 2D games such as Geometry Dash, Mario, and Galaga to be implemented using JSON configuration files to define game object positions and behaviors.

## Processor 
This project is a complete five-stage pipelined processor written in Verilog that implements an assembly language similar to MIPS32. This processor also contains a random number generation module that can be used to generate random 32 bit values.
