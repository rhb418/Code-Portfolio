      <description>(THIS SIMULATION SHOULD BE RUN WITH TRIANGLE GRID) This configuration shows a segregation simulation where there are few cells searching for a single neighbor.  They randomly change positions until reaching another cell of the same color.  This uses a Triangle grid, so the chance for a cell to be satisfied is greater than that in a square grid.</description>
